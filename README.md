## About
I have tried a number of ways to keep track of my projects and todo lists, and nothing really sticks. I seem to change my mind for every project. For *this* project, I want to use the power of meteor to track my progress.

*[ ] Create fixture data for the datastore this project should work with

*[ ] Projects page should include rows of project tiles

*[ ] Project tiles should include name of project, number of tasks, number of tasks completed (or maybe a progress bar of some kind?), and some kind of ranking (would love to try a drag and drop with persistence)

*[ ] Project page should have more info about project, tasks (incompleted items at the top), a method for ranking them, for adding them, and for editing them.

*[ ] Add a project page should have two forms. One for filling out the project details, the other for adding tasks.

*[ ] Tasks should be displayed in two orders: the incomplete ones in ranked order at the top of the list, and the completed ones (in the order completed) at the bottom.

*[ ] Multi-user
